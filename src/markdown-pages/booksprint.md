#GDL translation book sprint
On this page, you will find basic information on how to organize a translation books sprint.

A GDL translation booksprint is organized to involve your local community in the translation of GDL content and books into new languages. The GDL platform offers this as a great opportunity for schools, teachers, NGOs and publishers that want to translate content for use in their own organizations and projects.

A booksprint is usually organized as a virtual webinar in combination with workshops on one or more physical locations.

If you are planning your first booksprint, it is best to focus on simple, short reading books for children at GDL level 1 and 2. Usually, this means that one participant will be able to translate one book within one hour.

For more practical information and a step by step startup guide, please go to our translation [booksprint startup kit](https://home.digitallibrary.io/translation-startup-kit/).

Please contact us during the planning of your booksprint. If available, personnel from the Global Digital Library could be available during the workshop to answer questions and assist the participants as they translate books into their own language.

All new content, including translations, published on the GDL platform will be subject to quality assurance. Books translated during your event will not automatically be published for public use on the GLD. It will be available for you to share within your organisation.
