##Introduction
The goal of the [Global Book Alliance](http://globalbookalliance.org/) is to provide access to free, high-quality, early grade reading resources in languages that children use and understand.

As a flagship activity within the Global Book Alliance, the **Global Digital Library (GDL)** has been developed to increase the availability of high-quality reading resources in underserved languages worldwide.

##What is the purpose of the GDL?
The GDL collects existing high quality open educational reading resources, and makes them available on web, mobile and for print. By the end of 2018 the Library will offer resources in at least 25 languages, and by end 2020 at least 100 languages.

The platform also facilitates translation and localization of GDL-resources to more than 300 languages.

##Who can use the Global Digital Library?
The GDL is aimed at many different types of users and the platform will be open for everyone. Intended users include ministries of education, school managers, teachers, donor agencies and their implementing partners, international and national non-governmental organizations, local publishers, digital distributors and content providers, and households in developing countries.

The GDL platform is open for everyone and all the books and resources are available for free.

##Platform introduction
In this part, you will get a short introduction to the platform, including how to navigate languages, categories and levels.

_Video duration: 5 minutes._

##Preparations before the translation workshop/book sprint:

1. Create a list over translators participating at your event
2. Create a list of books to translate
3. Assign books to translators
4. Make sure that all translators have devices and that they are able to connect to the internet

You can choose to organize the translation event in one location or by organizing a webinar/online workshop with your translators connected via Skype or other virtual platforms.

Books translated during the book sprint events will not automatically be published for public use on the GDL. All new content, including translations, must undergo quality assurance in line with the GDL minimum standards before being published on the platform.

When translating you should always read the licensing terms connected to each book. If you are considering selling translated versions of a GDL-book, you must first check the licensing term for the book to assess if the license allows for commercial reuse.

##Find books that you would like to translate
You can pick any GDL-title available in E-PUB format on the platform to translate, but if you are just starting up a book sprint, it is best to look for short reading books on GDL [Level 1](https://digitallibrary.io/en/books/browse?readingLevel=1&category=library_books), [Level 2](https://digitallibrary.io/en/books/browse?readingLevel=2&category=library_books) and [Read Aloud](https://digitallibrary.io/en/books/browse?readingLevel=read-aloud&category=library_books).

Normally, in these levels, one translator will be able to translate one book within one hour.

By creating a spreadsheet with the titles you are working on it is easier to coordinate and assign tasks between translators.

##Get started with translation â€“ introduction
