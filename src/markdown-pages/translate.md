_Video explaining translation on the GDL in just over 90 seconds._

Getting started as a translator on the GDL platform and easy. It will only take a couple of minutes before you are on your way to translating your first book. Normally, when translating books at the easy levels, one translator will be able to translate one book within one hour.

##Find the book that you would like to translate
You can pick any GDL-title available in English on the platform to translate. If you are a new recruit and starting up as a translator today, it is best to look for short reading books on GDL [Level 1](https://digitallibrary.io/en/books/browse?readingLevel=1&category=library_books) and [Level 2](https://digitallibrary.io/en/books/browse?readingLevel=2&category=library_books).

##Follow the step by step guide to translation
We have created a step by step guide that will help you get going with translation. If you are new as a GDL translator, this guide will help you get up to speed quickly.
