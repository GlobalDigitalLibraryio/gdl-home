<summary>GDL key features</summary>

**Q1: What distinguishes the Global Digital Library from other digital libraries?**

A1: The Global Digital Library (GDL) has the following key characteristics;

- The GDL is a flagship initiative within the broader [Global Book Alliance](http://globalbookalliance.org/). It is a novel mechanism for sharing and reusing reading resources among governments, large international and multilateral donor organizations, and non-governmental and community organizations.
- All GDL-resources are
  - quality assured in line with minimum standards approved by the Global Book Alliance
  - free and openly licensed
- The GDL-platform
  - hosts Classroom and Library Materials
  - hosts materials both in print-friendly formats and formats suitable for digital reading
  - facilitates translation of resources to more than 300 languages.
  - will also host selected interactive resources, such as games, which can be used for self-learning of foundational literacy skills
  - follows international best practice guidelines for universal design and accessibility
- The GDL API allows others to reuse the titles also programmatically

The totality of this sets the GDL apart from other digital libraries, and means that the GDL does not duplicate existing initiatives but rather complements these efforts. The GDL will add value to many initiatives operating in the same space.

<summary>GDL content quality and editorial responsibility</summary>

**Q1: Who is behind the Global Digital Library?**

A1: The Global Digital Library (GDL) is a flagship initiative within [the Global Book Alliance](http://globalbookalliance.org/), a broad international partnership working to ensure that by 2030 all children have the books they need to learn to read.

The GDL is managed by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad), and operated by the Norwegian Digital Learning Arena (NDLA). Minimum standards for GDL content quality have been developed by reading experts with broad international expertise, and have been approved by the Global Book Alliance Steering Committee and by Norad. Day-to-day editorial responsibility for the Global Digital Library rests with NDLA.

You can read more about all the stakeholders involved in the GDL and the broader Global Book Alliance here: https://home.digitallibrary.io/about/.

You can find the GDL minimum standards here: https://home.digitallibrary.io/qa/.

**Q2: How can I be certain that a Global Digital Library book is of high quality?**

A2: All resources hosted on the Global Digital Library (GDL) are quality assured by relevant expertise to ensure that they are in accordance with the GDL minimum standards. The GDL minimum standards have been developed by reading experts with broad international expertise, and have been approved by the Global Book Alliance Steering Committee and by Norad. You can see the GDL minimum standards here: https://home.digitallibrary.io/qa/.

**Q3: Who provides the Global Digital Library with content?**

A3: The Global Digital Library (GDL) benefits greatly from being able to import quality resources from various projects and actors in content creation, instead of developing new content. Content in the Classroom Materials-category is mainly being drawn from USAID-missions and projects funded by All Children Reading: A Grand Challenge for Development. Content in the Library Materials-category is mainly from the African Storybook Initiative, Pratham Books and BookDash, while organizations like Asia Foundation are involved in translations and quality assurance. The number of content providers to the GDL will grow over time.

<summary>GDL licensing policy and opportunities for reuse</summary>

**Q1: Is it legal for anyone to use the titles and resources on the Global Digital Library (GDL) for free?**

A1: Yes, it is legal to re-use and even adapt all resources on the Global Digital Library. The GDL core platform will hold digital copies of Creative Commons or otherwise openly licensed, publicly accessible materials. All content will be marked with the correct license, authors, and illustrators. For more information see: http://home.digitallibrary.io/cc/.

**Q2: Can my organization put our logo on the materials and then print them for use in one of our education projects on the ground?**

A2: Yes, you can put your logo on printed materials, as long as correct attribution is given to authors and illustrators. For more information on how to give correct attribution see: https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution.

**Q3: I am a local publisher. Can I print and sell these resources?**

A3: For most of the resources the answer is “yes”! More than 90% of the resources in the Global Digital Library have licenses that allow you to re-use them also for commercial purposes. It is, however, extremely important to read the licensing information for each title/resource and follow the licensing agreement accordingly.

**Q4: Is there an API to access the Global Digital Library data and content programmatically?**

A4: Yes, the Global Digital Library project developed an OPDS feed with all content available to allow for reuse. The OPDS feed is accessible at https://api.digitallibrary.io/book-api/opds/v1/root.xml.

<summary>GDL and accessibility</summary>

**Q1: Is the Global Digital Library platform accessible for all users, including the visually impaired?**

A1: The Global Digital Library (GDL) platform follows established principles for universal design and accessibility and has a strong focus on making all content generally accessible, including for those with print disabilities, i.e. blindness or low vision, severe dyslexia, or mobility impairment.

The GDL platform is compliant with all Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 AA requirements and many AAA requirements. In total, the GDL platform will be compliant with more than 50 of the 61 WCAG 2.0 requirements. For more information on these guidelines please see http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/.

At the time of the GDL launch, many titles available do not yet have alt-text descriptions of illustrations. The GDL is working to add this functionality so partners can provide this; however, this enhancement will only be completed in the later part of 2018. In addition, resources not yet in accessible formats (see also Q2 below) will be completed on a rolling-basis and at the earliest convenience.

**Q2: What kind of file formats are supported on the GDL platform?**

A2: The primary content formats for the Global Digital Library (GDL) are HTML5 and EPUB3. However, some of the resources, originally design for print only, are being converted from PDF to more accessible formats. Thus, at the time of launch in April 2018, the Ethiopian Classroom Materials-resources are only available as PDFs, but within 2018 they will also be made available in more accessible formats.

<summary>GDL target users</summary>

**Q1: Who is the target user for Global Digital Library content**

A1: The goal of the Global Book Alliance is to ensure that by 2030 all children have the books they need to learn to read. To ensure that appropriate books reach children, the Global Digital Library (GDL) therefore supports many pathways. The GDL hosts books both for classroom use and for leisure reading by children, as well as books to read aloud for children. Furthermore, books can both be printed out and read on digital devices. The GDL is designed both to be user-friendly for children accessing it directly, and to support stakeholders that are important for reaching children, such as school teachers, librarians, parents, and other caretakers. The GDL is designed with these users in mind.

**Q2: Has the Global Digital Library platform and content been user tested with kids, parents, and teachers in relevant countries?**

A2: Yes, the GDL conducted user testing of both the website and the mobile app at locations in Ethiopia, Cambodia, and Nepal, and will continue to user test as the platform and content evolves. For more information on user testing conducted ahead of launch, please see this blog: https://blog.digitallibrary.io/2018/01/20/user-testing-in-ethiopia-and-cambodia/

**Q3: I am a teacher. Can I use these books in the classroom?**

A3: Resources in the Classrooms Materials-category are always government approved for classroom use. In countries where government approval is not required for supplementary reading materials, the Library Materials-category can also be a relevant source for books.

**Q4: I am a parent. Can I use these books with my children?**

A4: Yes, you can use these books with your children! Decodable resources are the easiest to read. Level 1 books are also quite easy, and then the difficulty level gradually increases to longer stories at Level 4. Resources labelled as Read-aloud have either not been leveled or are considered too difficult for early readers to read on their own. These books are meant to be read to or with children.

<summary>GDL content categories and types</summary>

**Q1: What is the difference between Classroom Materials and Library Materials?**

A1: The Global Digital Library (GDL) has two main content categories; Classroom Materials and Library Materials. Classroom Materials are always government approved and aligned to a national reading curriculum, whereas this is not required for Library Materials. For more information on the differences between the two categories, please see the [GDL minimum standards](https://home.digitallibrary.io/qa/).

**Q2: Is the Global Digital Library only hosting reading resources, or will you also cover other subjects and topics?**

A2: The Global Digital Library (GDL) only hosts high-quality reading resources. Still, given the wide range of topical content that reading resources can cover, GDL-content could seed learning and aspirations related to a range of other subject matters.

**Q3: Is the Global Digital Library only hosting reading books or will it also host more interactive resources such as games?**

A3: At the time of launch, the Global Digital Library only hosts reading books. In 2018 this will be expanded to include selected interactive resources (e.g. digital games) that can be used for self-learning of foundational literacy skills.

<summary>GDL languages and translation opportunities</summary>

**Q1: How have you selected which languages to include content in?**

A1: The Global Digital Library (GDL) will primarily hold books in underserved languages from all over the world, with a particular focus on languages used in low- and middle-income countries. “Underserved languages” refers to languages where there is currently a lack of quality early grade reading resources. The GDL is also hosting resources in English, as an important bridging language.

**Q2: My language is underserved! Why aren’t there any resources in my language in the Global Digital Library?**

A2: The Global Digital Library (GDL) aims to host resources in more than 100 languages by end 2020. However, the GDL launches with 15 languages. The plan is to go from 15 languages at launch April 2018, to 25-30 languages at the end of 2018, to at least 100 languages by the end of 2020. The speed of expansion is determined by 1) access to openly licensed quality reading resources, and 2) capacity to quality assure resources in new languages. In order to add a new language, the GDL needs to have a minimum of 20 titles in a language the user interface can support.

**Q3: How can we submit new reading resources or new language content for the Global Digital Library?**

A3: Content can be added to the Global Digital Library (GDL) in two ways. The GDL either imports new quality open source content or someone translates existing GDL-content to a different language and submits those resources for approval. In both cases, the content is quality assured with the GDL minimum standards before being accepted on the GDL. Initially, the GDL will prioritize importing batches of existing content from a limited number of established providers. The capacity to review and approve translated content will increase over time. In the meantime, organizations and individuals wishing to translate content for their own use can do so immediately.

**Q4: Can I translate GDL-content to use in my own work, without submitting the translated resources back to the GDL for approval?**

A4: Yes. Anyone can use tools in the platform to translate Global Digital Library-resources into more than 300 languages for use in their own work. Please note that some titles will only be available in PDF initially. These titles will not be translatable online until their conversion to more accessible formats.

**Q5: Is the GDL translation function based on machine translation?**

A5: No, the titles on the Global Digital Library (GDL) platform will not be subject to machine translation. The users will get some system support while they translate, but the final translation will always be done by a human. The GDL platform is integrated with Crowdin to support translation to more than 300 languages. Crowdin enables any user to translate resources, for their own use. The resources will not be published back on the platform.
