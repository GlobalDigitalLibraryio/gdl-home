## Global Book Alliance and the Global Digital Library

Major progress has been made towards increasing primary school enrolment rates. Still, 617 million children and adolescents worldwide are unable to read, despite most of them having attended school for several years. The mission of the [Global Book Alliance](http://globalbookalliance.org/) is to ensure that all children have access to high-quality, local language books at the right reading level, as well as the teaching and support they need to use them effectively to develop and sustain their literacy skills.

As a flagship activity within the Global Book Alliance, the [Global Digital Library (GDL)](https://digitallibrary.io/) will increase the availability of high-quality reading resources in underserved languages worldwide. The GDL collects existing high-quality open educational reading resources and makes them available on the web, mobile and for print. Our goal is to provide resources in 100 languages by the end of 2020. The platform also facilitates translation and localization of GDL-resources to more than 300 languages. At the time of launch, the GDL will host openly licensed high-quality reading resources in 41 languages, including Hindi, Marathi, Bangla, Khmer and reading resources in seven Nepali languages.

## The GDL platform is for everyone

From ministries of education, school managers, teachers, donor agencies, and international and national non-governmental organizations, to local publishers, digital distributors and content providers, and households in developing countries – the platform will be open for everyone.

Stakeholders can use these resources in their own programmes as print-outs or on digital devices, leading to an increase in the overall quality of reading instruction, while keeping production costs low.

## The Asia regional launch

The event will highlight the importance of the platform for stakeholders involved in reading materials development, primary education programming, or community reading programmes in the Asia region.

Ministries of education, donor community and NGOs working on supplementary reading materials, school managers, teachers, international and national non-governmental organizations, local publishers, digital distributors and content providers in Asia are encouraged to attend.
