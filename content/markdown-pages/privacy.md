##About this policy

GDL are committed to protect the privacy of all individuals who are using GDL services, including third-party services. In this policy, personal information means information relating to anyone who – by using our services and applications – can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number or email address, location data, and online identifier or to one or more factors specific to his/her physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.

The use of information collected through our services shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the users have accepted by explicit consent (check box below).

**The GDL project collects no personal userdata from users that access the web-site digitallibrary.io. Users accessing titles by download or directly on the web-site can do so without any personal data being collected. For users that log on and translate books and GDL titles, the GDL project will collect name and email adress.**

**Services that collect and store personal information**

Personal information is collected by the following third-party services:

- Auth0 for authentication (name and email address),
- AWS for storing user generated data related to translated learning materials.
- Zendesk for storing queries about content problems.

No personal information is stored in other GDL applications or services.

##What kind of personal information do we store?

GDL and its third-party subprocessors collects information about the users as part of the basic functionality of the solution. GDL and its third-party subprocessors thus store a minimum of data about you. GDL and subprocessors all follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. The different privacy policies of our subprocessors can be found here:

- https://auth0.com/security
- https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/
- https://www.zendesk.com/company/customers-partners/privacy-policy/

The specific personal information variables that will be stored are name and email address.

We may use the information we collect about you (including personal information, to the extent applicable) for a variety of purposes, including to provide, operate, maintain, improve, and promote the services; enable you to access and use the services; process and complete transactions, and send you related information; send transactional messages, including responses to your comments, questions, and requests; provide customer service and support; and send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages; send promotional communications, such as providing you with information about new features in GDL.

Personal information is only handled by GDLs operating personnel.

###Log data

This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses as well as browser type, internet service provider, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, the information you search for, language information, identification numbers associated with your devices, and system configuration information. Occasionally, we connect personal information to information gathered in our log files as necessary to improve our services. In such a case, we would treat the combined information in accordance with this policy.

###Single sign-on

Social media features and widgets are hosted by the relevant third party. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the companies that provide them.

As part of GDL Facebook campaigns we use an element called Pixel. The Facebook pixel receives these types of data:

- Http Headers – Anything present in HTTP headers. HTTP Headers are a standard web protocol sent between any browser request and any server on the internet. HTTP Headers include IP addresses, information about the web browser, page location, document, referrer and person using the website.
- Pixel-specific Data – Includes Pixel ID and the Facebook Cookie.
- Button Click Data – Includes any buttons clicked by site visitors, the labels of those buttons and any pages visited as a result of the button clicks.
- Optional Values – Developers and marketers can optionally choose to send additional information about the visit through conversion tracking. Example custom data events are conversion value, page type, and more.
- Form Field Names – Includes website field names like ‘email’, ‘address’, ‘quantity’ for when you purchase a product or service. We don’t capture field values unless you include them as part of Advanced Matching, conversion tracking, or user properties.
